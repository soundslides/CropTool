# CropTool

A simple tool allowing you to crop an image to a custom size based on certain transformations. The aspect ratio will always be maintained.

The transformations available are:
* Fit: Scale images to fit the size, no cropping
* Height: Fill images to the size's height (cropping may be necessary)
* Width: Fill images to the size's width (cropping may be necessary)
* Fill: Fill the entire size w/the image (cropping may be necessary)

Mainly created as a thought exercise to demonstrate how to do the above things in Objective-C.
